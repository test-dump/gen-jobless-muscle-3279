This namespace contains the `Console` class.\n\n2. `class Program` - This is a declaration of a new class. A class is a container for methods and data related to those methods.\n\n3. `static void Main()` - This is the Main method of the class. This is the entry point for the application.\n\n4. `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` - This is a method provided by the Console class in the System namespace. It prints the string given as a parameter to the console. In this case, \"Hello World!\" will be printed."}]
