Here is a simple Hello World console application written in C#:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. `using System;` - This is a using directive that brings the System namespace into scope. This namespace contains the `Console` class.

2. `class Program` - This is a declaration of a new class. A class is a container for methods and data related to those methods.

3. `static void Main()` - This is the Main method of the class. This is the entry point for the application.

4. `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` - This is a method provided by the Console class in the System namespace. It prints the string given as a parameter to the console. In this case, "Hello World!" will be printed.
